# Black Jack Project 1  
## Introduction
The aim of this project was to be able to create a functioning Black Jack game. With the standard rules of Black Jack applied.  
  
The player starts off with $100 but is able to add more with a deposit option. The player has the option of betting in increments of 5, 10, 25, or 50 dollars.

The player must bet before starting the game. Once the bet has been entered, new round needs to be clicked for the cards to be dealt.

## Game Rules

* The rules of the game are: 
* The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
* Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.
* Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.
* To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.
* If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
* If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.
* Blackjack usually means you win 1.5 the amount of your bet. Depends on the casino.
* Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher.

## Future Enhancements
* Adding more than one deck when playing the game
* Adding a split and double down function
* Allow the game to be played on all different browser sizes.
